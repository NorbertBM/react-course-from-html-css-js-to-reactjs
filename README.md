## Complete React Guide including (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux, Styled Components)

Welcome to my comprehensive React course for beginners! If you're someone who has experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and wants to take your web development skills to the next level, then this is the course for you.

Throughout this course, I'll guide you through the basics of React, including how to build and structure React components, use React hooks, and create multiple projects to help you practice your newfound skills.

To start off, we'll take a look at what React is and why it's such an important tool in the web development industry. React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, and it's become incredibly popular over the years due to its flexibility and ease of use. In fact, many companies, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Airbnb, use React to build their web applications.

With that in mind, we'll dive into the basics of React, including how to set up your development environment, create a basic React component, and how to render that component to the browser. From there, we'll explore the various React components that you can use, such as function components and class components, and how to structure your components in a way that makes sense for your application.

Next, we'll delve into React hooks, which are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. We'll go through the various hooks, including useState, useEffect, useContext, and more, and show you how to use them in your applications to make your code more concise and easier to read.

Finally, we'll round out the course with multiple projects that you can work on to apply your newfound knowledge. These projects will include creating a simple to-do list application, a movie search application, and a weather app. By the end of the course, you'll have a solid understanding of how to build React applications and the confidence to create your own projects.

In conclusion, our React course for beginners is the perfect way to take your web development skills to the next level. With our comprehensive approach, we'll guide you through the basics of React, teach you how to use React components and hooks, and provide you with multiple projects to practice your skills. React is an important tool in the web development industry, and with this course, you'll be well on your way to becoming a proficient React developer.

Here is a list of all the hooks available in React and I will be teaching in this course, along with a short description of what they do:

- useState: Allows you to add state to a functional component by providing a state variable and a function to update it.

- useEffect: Allows you to perform side effects (such as fetching data or updating the DOM) after a component has rendered or before it's about to unmount.

- useContext: Allows you to access data stored in a context object without having to pass props down through multiple levels of components.

- useReducer: Allows you to manage complex state in a predictable way, by taking in a reducer function and an initial state value.

- useCallback: Allows you to memoize a function, which can help with performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components.

- useMemo: Allows you to memoize a value, which can help with performance by preventing unnecessary calculations.

- useRef: Allows you to create a mutable reference to a value or DOM element, which can be useful for accessing the DOM directly or persisting values across renders.

- useLayoutEffect: Similar to useEffect, but runs synchronously after all DOM mutations have completed, which can be useful for manipulating the DOM directly.

- useImperativeHandle: Allows you to customize the instance value that's exposed to parent components when using ref.

- useDebugValue: Allows you to add a label to a custom hook, which can be useful for debugging and tracing the flow of data in your application.

These hooks are some of the most commonly used ones in React, and can be incredibly powerful when used correctly. By understanding how each hook works and when to use it, you can build more complex and performant applications with ease.
